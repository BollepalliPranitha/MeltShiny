Contains working MeltWin2.0 code.
The purpose of this application is to easily and consistantly fit data to obtain thermodynamic patterns. This uses the MeltR libarary to do all calcuations. The goal is to add a graphical user internface to make our application work closer to how MeltWin, MeltR's predicessor, does. This means adding an easy to use graphical user interface to it.

This code can be run by downloading and saving it and using the run app button in RStudio or 
using the lineshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
This uses the MeltR, shiny, dplyr, and ggplot2 libaries.
